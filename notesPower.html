        <div class = "def">
            Have you ever wondered, "How do I simplify expressions like: \(2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2\)?"<br>
            This is where powers come quite handy as \(2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \) can be expressed in powers as \(2^4\)!
        </div>

        <div class = sticky-note-yellow>
            <p>
               A <span style="font-weight: bold;">power</span> (or exponent) represents the number of times a base number is multiplied by itself. <br>It consists of two parts: the <span style="font-weight: bold;"> base</span> and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">exponent</span>. <br>The exponent indicates how many times the base is multiplied by itself. 
            </p>
        </div>


            <p class = "example">Example:  \(3^2\) <br> </p>
            <div class = "solution">
                <p> - 3 is the Base <br>
                    - 2 is the Exponent<br>
                    - This expression can be read as "3 raised to the power of 2"<br>
                   - It means \(3 \times 3\) 
                </p>     
            </div>
        


            <p class = "example">Example:  How could you represent \(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3\) as a power? <br>
                Identify the base and the exponent.<br> </p>
            <div class = "solution">
                <p>Solution:</p>
                <p> - \(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 3^5\) <br>
                    - 3 is the Base <br>
                    - 5 is the Exponent<br>
                </p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Even Exponents:</span> </p>
                    When a base is raised to an even exponent, the result is always positive, regardless of the sign of the base.
                    <br><br> ex) \((-2)^2\) equals 4

                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Odd Exponents:</span> </p>
                    When a base is raised to an odd exponent, the result retains the sign of the base. If the base is positive, the result is positive, and if the base is negative, the result is negative.
                    <br><br> ex) \((-2)^3\) equals -8

                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Zero Exponents:</span></p>
                    An exponent of zero (0) results in the value of 1, regardless of the base. Any number raised to the power of zero equals 1.<br><br>
                    ex) \((-2)^0\) equals 1
                </div>
            </div>

                <p>Solution:</p>
                <p> No it is not the same.
                    <br>- This is because \((-2)^4 = 16\) and \(-(2)^4 = -16\)

        <ul class = "subsubtitle">2.4 Word Problems</ul>
        <p class = "def"> When we're learning about exponents, we often come across word problems. <br>Let's solve a typical question together to make things clearer!</p>
        <p class = "example"> Example: A dish holds 100 bacteria. It is known that the bacteria double in number every hour. How many bacteria will be present after 5 hours?</p>

        <div class = "solution">
            <p>Step 1) Initial amount of bacteria: It is given that the dish holds 100 bacteria <br>
               Step 2) Rate of growth: It is known that the bacteria double in number every hour. So, the growth rate (or factor) is 2.<br>
               Step 3) Number of hours: We are solving the number of bacterias after 5 hours.<br>
               Putting these information together, we can calculate the final amount of bacteria.<br>
               <br>Final amount = Initial amount × \( (\text{Growth rate})^{\text{Number of hours}} \) <br>
                - Sub in the values that we found in steps 1), 2), 3) <br>
                Final amount = 100 × \( (2)^5 = 100 \times 32 = 3200 \)
                <br><br>
                Therefore, after 5 hours, there will be 3200 bacteria present.
