    <h1 id = "title"> Square Roots </h1>
    <div class = "container">
    <h2 class = "subtitle">1. Square Roots</h2>
    <ul class = "subsubtitle">1.1 What is a Square Root?</ul>
    <div class = "def">
    <p >Have you ever thought about figuring out a question like this: "What number do you need to multiply by itself to get 25?"</p>
    <p >Solving that might seem tricky, which is why we introduce square roots to make it easier!</p>
</div>

<div class = "sticky-note-yellow">
    <p>A Square Root is a mathematical operation that helps us find a number which, when multiplied by itself, gives us another number.<br>
    More precisely, the Square Root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.</p>
</div>
    <p class = "example">For Example: </p>
    <p class = "example">The square root of 9 is 3 because 3 × 3 = 9 <br>
        The square root of 16 is 4 because 4 × 4 = 16. <br>
        The square root of 25 is 5 because 5 × 5 = 25. </p>
    <p class = "def">The Square Root Symbol is used to represent the square root of any number.</p>
    <p class = "example"> Square Root Symbol: \(\sqrt{x}\) <br>
    where x is called the radicand</p>
    <p class = "example"></p>We can simply write the square root of 25 as \(\sqrt{25}\)</p>
    <p class = "example"></p>Again, if we rewrite our previous example with the square root symbol..</p>
    <p class = "example">\(\sqrt{9} = 3\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{16} = 4\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{25} = 5\) </p>
    <p class = "def">As shown in the example, some numbers have whole number square roots, like 4 (whose square root is 2) and 9 (whose square root is 3). These are called perfect squares.</p>
    <p class = "def">For these perfect squares, simply consider the root as undoing the square process.</p>
    <p class = "example">\(\sqrt{9} = \sqrt{3^2} = 3\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{16} = \sqrt{4^2} = 4\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{25} = \sqrt{5^2} = 5\)</p>

    <p class = "def">However, Square roots can also be irrational numbers, meaning their decimal representations go on forever without repeating. <br>For instance, \(\sqrt{2}\) (the square root of 2) is approximately 1.41421356...</p>


    <ul class = "subsubtitle">1.2 Perfect Squares</ul>
    <p class = "example">These are the perfect squares that you should know and memorize: </p>
    <p class = "example">
        \(\sqrt{1} = \sqrt{1^2} = 1\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{4} = \sqrt{2^2} = 2\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{9} = \sqrt{3^2} = 3\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{16} = \sqrt{4^2} = 4\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{25} = \sqrt{5^2} = 5\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{36} = \sqrt{6^2} = 6\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{49} = \sqrt{7^2} = 7\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{64} = \sqrt{8^2} = 8\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{81} = \sqrt{9^2} = 9\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{100} = \sqrt{10^2} = 10\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{121} = \sqrt{11^2} = 11\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{144} = \sqrt{12^2} = 12\) <br>
        \(\sqrt{169} = \sqrt{13^2} = 13\) <br>
    </p>





    <ul class = "subsubtitle">1.3 Square Root Properties</ul>
    <div class = "sticky-note-yellow">
    <ul><div class = "bold">Product Property: </div> The square root of a product is equal to the product of the square roots of the factors.<br>
   \(\sqrt{ab} =  \sqrt{a} × \sqrt{b}\) <br> </ul>
   <ul><div class = "bold">Quotient Property: </div>The square root of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the square roots of the numerator and the denominator. <br>
    \( \frac{ \sqrt{a}}{ \sqrt{b}}  =  \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}\) <br> </ul>
    <ul><div class = "bold">Zero Square Root: </div>The square root of zero is zero. <br>
        Mathematically, \(\sqrt{0} =  0\) <br> </ul>
    <ul><div class = "bold">Addition and Subtraction: </div>Unlike multiplication and division, square roots do not distribute over addition and subtraction. <br>
        For example:   \(\sqrt{a + b}\) is NOT necessarily  \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}  \) <br> </ul>
</div>



    <ul class = "subsubtitle">1.4 Solving \(x^2 = a\) with Square Roots </ul>
    <div class = "def">
    <p>When you have an equation in the form \(x^2 = a\), you can solve for \(x\)
         by taking the square root of both sides. <br>This means when \(x^2 = a\), then \(\sqrt(x^2) = \sqrt{a}\) </p>
    <p>However, we need to keep in mind that when we take the square root, we often need to consider both the positive and negative possibilities to cover all potential solutions. </p>
    <p>What does that mean?: <br>
    When we square a number, whether it is a positive or negative, we get a positive result.<br>
    ex) \((-3)^2 = 9\) and \((3)^2 = 9\)</p>
    <p>That being said, in the equation \(x^2 = a\), \(x\) could be either positive or negative. <br>
        So, including both positive and negative square roots covers all possible values of 
        \(x\) that satisfy the equation.</p>
    </div>


    <p class = "example">Example: Solve the equation \(x^2 = 25\) </p>
    <div class = "solution">
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Step 1) Take the Square Root on both sides:<br>
         \(\sqrt(x^2) = \sqrt{25}\)
         </p>
        <p>Step 2) Simplify:<br>
            \(x = \pm 5\)
            </p>
        <p>Step 3) Check Your Solution:<br>
                Substitute  \(x = 5\) and \(x = - 5\) back into the original equation,  \(x^2 = 25\), to make sure they satisfy it. 
                <br>  \(5^2 = 25\) and  \((-5)^2 = 25\) so both solutions are valid.
                </p>

        <p>Therefore, the answer is \(x = \pm 5\)</p>

    <ul class = "subsubtitle">1.5 Square Root Word Problems</ul>
    <p class = "def">Word problems are a common part of high school math, and they're something we can't escape! <br>Let's tackle some examples together to get a better handle on how to approach them.</p>
    <p class = "example"> Example 1: A rectangle has a length twice as long as it is width and an area of 242 \(m^2\).<br>
         Determine the length and width of the rectangle. </p>
    <p class = "solution"> Solution:  </p>
    <p class = "solution"> Step 1) Understand the problem: <br> We're given that the rectangle's length is twice its width, and the area of the rectangle is 242 \(m^2\). <br>
        We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.  </p>
    <p class = "solution"> Step 2) Assign variables: <br> Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \(w\) meters
        Since the length is twice the width, we can denote the length as \(2w\) meters.  </p>
    <p class = "solution"> Step 3) Write down the formula for the area of a rectangle: <br> The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
        \(A = length × width\)</p>
    <p class = "solution"> Step 4) Use the given information to set up an equation:<br>  We know that the area of the rectangle is 242 \(m^2\). 
        <br> So, we can write the equation:
        <br> \(A = 2w × w\)
        <br> \(242 = 2w^2\)</p>
    <p class = "solution"> Step 5) Solve the equation: <br>Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \(w^2\) <br>
        \(w^2 = \frac{242}{2}\) <br>
        \(w^2 = 121\) <br>
        Take the square root of both sides to solve for \(w^2\) <br>
        \(w = \sqrt{121}\) <br>
        \(w = \sqrt{11}\) 
    </p>
    <p class = "solution"> Step 6) Find the length of the rectangle: <br> Since the length is twice the width, we have <br>
        \(length = 2w\) <br>
        \(length = 2 × 11\) <br>
        \(length = 22\) 
    </p>
    <p class = "solution"> Step 7) Check the solution: To verify, we can calculate the area using the found values of 
        \(w\) and  \(length\) <br>
        \(A = 22 × 11\) <br>
        \(A = 242 m^2\) 
    </p>
    <p class = "solution"> Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 22 meters and the width is 11 meters. 
    </p>
    <p class = "example"> Example 2: A rectangle has a length 50% longer than the width, and an area of 6 \(cm^2\).
        <br> Determine the length and width of the rectangle. </p>
        <p class = "solution"> Solution:  </p>
        <p class = "solution"> Step 1) Understand the problem: <br> We're given that the length of the rectangle is 50% longer than its width, and the area of the rectangle is 
            6 \(cm^2\). We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.</p>
        <p class = "solution"> Step 2) Assign variables: <br> Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \(w\) centimeters
                Since the length is 50% longer than the width, we can denote the length as \(1.5 w\) meters.  </p>
        <p class = "solution"> Step 3) Write down the formula for the area of a rectangle: <br> The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
                    \(A = length × width\)</p>
        <p class = "solution"> Step 4) Use the given information to set up an equation:<br>  We know that the area of the rectangle is 6 \(cm^2\).
                    <br> So, we can write the equation:
                    <br> \(A = (1.5)w × w\)
                    <br> \(6 = 1.5 w^2\)</p>
        <p class = "solution"> Step 5) Solve the equation: <br>Divide both sides of the equation by 1.5 to isolate \(w^2\) <br>
                    \(w^2 = \frac{6}{1.5}\) <br>
                    \(w^2 = 4\) <br>
                    Take the square root of both sides to solve for \(w^2\) <br>
                    \(w = \sqrt{4}\) <br>
                    \(w = 2\)  </p>
        <p class = "solution"> Step 6) Find the length of the rectangle: <br> Since the length is 1.5 times the width, we have <br>
                    \(length = 1.5w\) <br>
                    \(length = 1.5 × 2\) <br>
                    \(length = 3\) 
                </p>
                <p class = "solution"> Step 7) Check the solution: To verify, we can calculate the area using the found values of 
                    \(w\) and  \(length\) <br>
                    \(A = 3 × 2\) <br>
                    \(A = 6 cm^2\) 
                </p>
                <p class = "solution"> Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 
                    3 centimeters and the width is 2 centimeters.
