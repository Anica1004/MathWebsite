        <p>When comparing rational numbers, you're determining which one is greater, less than, or equal to another number. Here are some methods to compare rational numbers:</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "side-note-container">

        <div class = "sidenote">
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Common Denominator Method</span><br>
                - Convert fractions to have a common denominator. <br>
                - Compare the numerators. <br>
                - The fraction with the greater numerator is the greater number.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "sidenote">
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Decimal Comparison</span>  - Convert fractions to decimals. <br>
                - Use the decimal representations to compare the numbers directly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "sidenote">
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number Line</span> <br>
                - Plot the numbers on a number line. <br>
                - The number to the right is greater, and the number to the left is lesser.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "example">
        <p>Example: Which fraction is greater, \(\frac{3}{4}\) or \(\frac{2}{3}\) </p>
    </div>


    <div class = "solution">
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Method 1) Common Denominator Method<br>
        The least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12.<br>Now we rewrite both fractions with the common denominator of 12: <br>
        \(\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{9}{12}\)<br>
        \(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{8}{12}\) <br>
        Now we compare the numerators:  \(9 \gt 8\) <br>
        Since 9 is greater than 8, \(\frac{9}{12}\) is greater than \(\frac{8}{12}\). <br>
        Therefore, \(\frac{3}{4}\) is greater than \(\frac{2}{3}\)
      </p>
      <p>Method 2) Decimal Comparison Method<br>
        Convert both fractions to decimals and compare them directly.<br>
        \(\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\)<br>
        \(\frac{2}{3} = 0.\overline{6}\) <br>
        Now we compare the decimals: \(0.75 \gt 0.\overline{6} \) 
        Therefore, \(\frac{3}{4}\) is greater than \(\frac{2}{3}\)
    </p>
    <p>Method 3) Number Line Method<br>
        Plot the fractions oon a number line. <br>
        \(\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\)<br>
        \(\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667\) <br>
        On the number line: <br>
        <img src="numberline.png" alt="Number Line Image" style="max-width: 50%;"> <br>
       Since \(\frac{3}{4}\) is the right of \(\frac{2}{3}\), \(\frac{3}{4}\) is greater than \(\frac{2}{3}\).

               \( \frac{3}{5} = \frac{6}{10} \) <br>
               Since \(\frac{1}{10}\) already has the desired denominator, we don't need to change it. <br>
               Step 3) Add the fractions: Now that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add them together.
               <br> \(\frac{6}{10} + \frac{1}{10} =  \frac{7}{10} \)
