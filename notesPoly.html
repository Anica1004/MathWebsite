                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Variables:</span> </p>
                <p>Variables are symbols that represent unknown or unspecified quantities. In algebraic expressions and equations, variables are often denoted by letters like  \(x, y, z\), etc.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terms:</span> </p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Coefficients:</span> </p>
                <p>Coefficients are the numerical factors attached to variables in algebraic expressions. So when a term is the product of a number and one or more variables, the number is called the coefficient of the term.</p>

                <p>A degree of a term is the sum of the exponents on the variables of a single term. <br>

                <p>Solution: <br></p>
                <p>For every constant like 10, the degree is 0, because it can be represented as  \(10x^0\).<br>
